        <h3>I am a Photographer and Historian based in Chicago.</h3>
        <p>I am a Chicago-based photographer and Bachelor of Arts candidate in History at the University of Chicago. I was born and raised in sunny Singapore but came to the US for College in 2019. As a historian and photographer, memory is important to my work. That’s why I am committed to using my photography to preserve cherished memories!</p>

        <p>My photography journey started in 2014 on a trip to the United States. I picked up my dad’s Sony A33 and started randomly taking photos of the city and of the people around me. Since then, I have brought that Sony A33, a Nikon D7200, and currently a Nikon Z6 on my hikes, travels, and adventures and it has been amazing fun!</p>
          
        <p>I’d like to give my best shot at capturing your memories for you!</p>
